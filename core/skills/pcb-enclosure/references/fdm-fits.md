# FDM fit values

Starting values, to be calibrated with one test coupon print. Values are for a 0.4 mm nozzle, PLA or PETG. dfam-check does not cover fits; these do.

Calibrated on: ______________________ (printer, nozzle, material, date)

## Test coupon

A 30x30x5 mm plate with:
- through holes 2.8 / 3.0 / 3.2 / 3.4 mm (which one passes an M3 screw freely)
- a few slots (e.g. 3.2 x 8 mm) to check slot width and length
- a 10 mm peg on one side with mating 10.2 / 10.3 / 10.4 mm holes (press vs sliding fit)

Print it flat, measure or try the fits, then overwrite the values below.
