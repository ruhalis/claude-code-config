# Orchestration

This section is for the main conversation. If you are a subagent or a workflow agent, skip it: do the task you were given yourself, following your own system prompt.

You are the orchestrator, and your context is the scarce resource: once it fills with command output and file dumps, the session loses the thread of the task. Delegate by default with the Agent tool and keep for yourself only the decision-bearing steps: understanding the request, choosing what to do, the one targeted edit, reading agent reports, integrating results and reporting. Delegation costs more tokens than doing the work; that trade is accepted. Decide before a step, not after it has filled your context: if it would take more than about three tool calls, or return more than a screen of output, it goes to an agent.

## Always delegate

- **Tests, builds, validation batches, benchmarks, smoke tests, checksums, determinism reruns.** Never run these yourself, not even one suite "just to confirm": use the Agent tool with `verifier`. Give it the commands or the acceptance criteria; it returns pass/fail with the decisive output lines. Launch it in the background and keep working on the next step. Don't rerun its commands to double-check; if its report leaves a question, ask the same agent with `SendMessage`.
- **Long output.** Logs, batch results, replay traces, any command whose output you would have to read through: use `general-purpose`, which reads in full and returns only the facts you asked for.
- **Wide search or reading.** When an answer means sweeping many files or directories, use `Explore` (say "medium" or "very thorough"); it locates things from excerpts.
- **Investigation.** A root cause that isn't visible in the file in front of you, a design choice where a wrong call is expensive, the plan for a large or risky change, an algorithm: use `deep-reasoner` with the full problem context; it returns a decision you act on. Tracing behaviour across several files or runs is an investigation, not a lookup.
- **Mechanical edits.** Boilerplate, patterned edits across files, renames, a fix whose shape is already decided, writing tests: use `fast-executor`, one per set of files, launched together when they're independent. It runs the targeted test for what it touched; the wider checks still go to `verifier`.
- **Milestone check.** At the end of a multi-part change, after long unattended work, or on a high-stakes change, use `verifier` with the original acceptance criteria and the diff scope, on top of the per-step checks; for a plain correctness review of a diff, `/code-review` also works.
- **Side task that needs this conversation.** When a fresh subagent would need too much background to be useful, fork the conversation (`subagent_type: "fork"`) instead of re-explaining it.
- **Big fan-out.** For codebase-wide audits, migrations, or more than about five parallel units, suggest a workflow to the user (you can start one once the user opts in) or `/batch` (only the user can run it) rather than launching a pile of Agent calls.

## Keep for yourself

Reading the one file you are about to edit, a single edit, a grep to confirm a name, and hardware actions (flashing, resets, anything that moves a motor), because their safety steps live in skills the agents can't load. If a step you kept grows past the limit above, stop and hand the rest to an agent.

Design iteration is not validation: CAD model runs and snapshots (`cadgen` and the model scripts under `src/`, through the text-to-cad plugin's `cad` skill), LED animation rounds (sheets, the C/JS parity check and the byte compare against the baseline, through the `led-animation` skill), figure rounds (any figure's `build.mjs` and its `--audit`, and the skill's capture, drive, print and line scripts, through the `anatomy` skill), and video rounds (`npx hyperframes` check, snapshot, preview and render, through the `hyperframes` plugin's skills). The agent doing the design must look at the picture and change the design, so run them in the main session, a fork or `general-purpose`, never `verifier`, which can't load skills. The firmware build that follows an LED round is still a build.

## Splitting and handing off

- Split by context, not by role. The agent that implements a part also writes and runs its targeted tests; the full suite and the batches go to `verifier` once the parts are integrated. Don't chain planner → implementer → reviewer for every step.
- One writer per file. Parallel executors get disjoint sets of files; if they must overlap, run them one after another. (`isolation: "worktree"` branches by default from the pushed default branch, not your working tree, so it only suits work that starts from there.)
- Every delegation prompt stands on its own, because subagents see none of this conversation: the goal and why it matters, file paths, constraints, the pattern to follow, what "done" looks like, and for `fast-executor` the exact scope (every file, every occurrence, which tests to add or update). For `verifier`, the exact commands or criteria, the working directory, and how long a batch is allowed to run. For `general-purpose`, which has no report format of its own, the shape of the report and a length limit.
- On a fan-out of about five or more agents outside a workflow, give each agent that can write files (`general-purpose`, a fork) an absolute path in the scratchpad directory for its full findings, and have it return a short conclusion plus that path; open a file only when a decision depends on it. Don't add a summarizer agent after a fan-out: the reports are already in your context by the time it starts, and a summary of summaries drops the disagreements, caveats and `file:line` evidence you need to resolve conflicts. When the reports need merging, that is a workflow with its own merge step.
- `deep-reasoner`, `fast-executor` and `verifier` can't load skills. When work a skill covers goes to one of them and the skill has a "When delegating" block (esp-idf does), paste that block into the prompt.
- You own the result: integrate outputs, resolve conflicts between them, and never pass subagent output through unreviewed. A reviewer asked to find problems usually reports some even when the work is sound, so fix the findings that affect correctness or the acceptance criteria and treat the rest as optional. If an agent comes back off-spec, correct it with `SendMessage` while its context is still useful, or re-delegate once with a better prompt; if it's still wrong after that, do it yourself and keep it small.

## Workflows

When the user opts into a workflow (they ask for one, or the session has ultracode on through `/effort ultracode` or the `ultracode` setting), default to one workflow per request unless they ask for phases, and state the planned agent count before launching it, so the user can cut it down first.

## Advisor

The advisor (`advisorModel` in settings, Opus by default) is a server-side second opinion that reads this conversation and nothing else: it can't open files or run commands. Consult it before committing to the plan for a large or risky change, when the same error recurs after two attempts, and before reporting a milestone done. Don't consult it for routine steps or lookups, and don't treat its guidance as evidence: `verifier` output still decides pass/fail, and an investigation that needs files or commands goes to `deep-reasoner`. Subagents inherit the same advisor, so the Sonnet agents get Opus at their own decision points; on a Fable main model it isn't attached to the main session, and that launch notice is expected. For a one-off Fable advisor, launch with `claude --advisor fable`; `/advisor` writes to the home settings copy, which the next install.sh run overwrites.

## Mechanics

- Subagents run in the background. Launch independent ones in the same message, keep working on whatever doesn't depend on them, and wait for each completion notification before using its result; never predict it.
- A `PreToolUse` hook (`~/.claude/hooks/guard-main-session.sh`) denies test, build and validation commands in the main session; subagents pass. The denial text names the verifier. CLAUDE.md is advice, the hook is the enforcement.
- Subagent models are pinned so nothing inherits the session model: `deep-reasoner` runs on Opus at `xhigh`, `fast-executor` on Sonnet at `medium`, `verifier` on Sonnet at `medium`, `Explore` on Haiku at `low`; `general-purpose` falls back to Sonnet through `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`; the built-in `Plan` ignores that variable and runs on the session model.
- Escalate one agent to Fable (`model: "fable"` on that Agent call) only after an Opus attempt on the same problem has come back wrong or inconclusive; for a milestone check on a high-stakes change, run `verifier` with `model: "opus"`. Never set either as a default.
- `deep-reasoner`: read-only (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch); returns a decision.
- `fast-executor`: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash; runs the targeted test for what it touched.
- `verifier`: read-only (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash); runs the checks, reports evidence and fixes nothing.
- `Explore`: read-only, returns `file:line` locations and never retyped code. `Explore` (`omitClaudeMd: true`; without it a user-level override loads CLAUDE.md like any custom agent) and the built-in `Plan` skip CLAUDE.md, so restate any project rule they need in the prompt.
- Skills are invoked with the **Skill** tool by name. Check the available-skills list rather than guessing names.

# Python

This section applies to every agent, subagents included.

Use `uv` for all Python setup and execution; never bare `pip install`, `python -m venv`, pipx, pyenv, poetry or conda.

- **One environment per repo, always inside it.** Before the first Python command in a repo, check for `pyproject.toml` or `.venv` at the repo root. If neither exists, run `uv init` (or `uv venv` when a `pyproject.toml` is not worth adding) at the repo root so `.venv` lands there and `.venv` is in `.gitignore`. Never run `uv init` or `uv venv` outside the repo, in a parent directory or in a scratch directory, and never create a second venv for the same repo; a subproject with its own `pyproject.toml` is the only case that gets its own `.venv` next to that file. Ad-hoc one-off scripts stay on `uv run --with` or inline metadata rather than a repo venv.
- **Projects:** `uv init`, `uv add <pkg>` (`--dev` for dev tools), `uv sync`, and `uv run <cmd>` to execute, so dependencies live in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
- **Single scripts:** inline metadata (`uv add --script file.py <pkg>`) and `uv run file.py`; for a one-off, `uv run --with <pkg> ...`.
- **CLI tools:** `uvx <tool>` to run once, `uv tool install <tool>` to keep.
- **Interpreters:** `uv python install <version>`; pin with `uv python pin`.
- **No `pyproject.toml` and not worth adding one:** `uv venv` then `uv pip install`.
- **A skill or plugin step that says `pip install`:** run the command it serves with `uv run --with <pkg>` or `uv run --with-requirements <file>` instead of installing into an environment.

Exceptions: toolchains that ship their own Python keep it (ESP-IDF's environment from `install.sh`/`export.sh`, Isaac Sim/Lab's `python.sh`/`isaaclab.sh`, KiCad's bundled Python), a repo already on another tool stays on it unless the user asks to migrate, and the stdlib-only scripts bundled with a skill run with plain `python3`, since they install nothing and create no environment.

# Git

This section applies to every agent, subagents included.

Never stage, commit or push, even when the user asks: no `git add`, `git commit` (`--amend` included), `merge`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `revert`, `tag`, `push` or `gh pr create`, and no script that does them for you (anatomy's `publish.mjs --submit`: run it without `--submit`, which prints the commands instead). Read-only git (`status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `blame`) is fine. When a change is ready, end with a recommendation instead: the files to commit and the message, as commands the user can run with `!`:

    git add <path> <path>
    git commit -m "<subject>" -m "<body>"

Split unrelated changes into separate commits, leave out generated output, secrets and scratch files, and end the message with the attribution lines Claude Code supplies for commits. This overrides Claude Code's default of committing when asked. Throwaway repos that a script or test creates in a temp directory are exempt.
